# Long Term Projects
* https://github.com/GDBobby/VulkanFramework mostly finished, but still in progress from-scratch rewrite of my [former vulkan framework](https://github.com/GDBobby/Eight-Winds-Framework) focusing on modern vulkan and C++ techniques
* https://github.com/GDBobby/EWEngine Currently doing a from-scratch rewrite of my [former graphic's engine](https://github.com/GDBobby/Eight-Winds-Engine) building on top of my remade vulkan framework
* https://github.com/GDBobby/LAB Fully constexpr and cross-platform deterministic Linear Algebra Framework. Mostly finished, just a few minor tweaks are required for being able to support directx. Includes benchmarks against other popular Linear Algebra libraries
